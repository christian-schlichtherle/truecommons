 * An abstract service for providing visible and/or audible feedback to the

 * before.
 * Decorator services are subject to service location by the
 * {@link InvalidKeyFeedbackLocator#SINGLETON}.
 * If multiple decorator services are locatable on the class path at run time,
 * they are applied in ascending order of their
 * {@linkplain #getPriority() priority} so that the product of the decorator
 * service with the greatest number becomes the head of the resulting product
 * chain.
